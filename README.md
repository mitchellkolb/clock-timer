This project is a intended to be posted to Flathub to be able to be downloaded on my Linux PC because apparently there is no preinstalled timer app like on windows or macos. And the options that are avaliable on the software manager just don't have the functionality that these basic clock/timers apps should have.

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on my Linux desktop using information from the [PyGOject site](https://pygobject.gnome.org/getting_started.html#ubuntu-getting-started) and this [GTK YouTube Video.](https://youtu.be/Yu2EBmeCpJw?si=1T4h0TMkTJBPFGvC)
- Clone this repository 
- `sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev gcc libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev gir1.2-gtk-4.0`
- In the codebase that was cloned create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Download External Python Libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- The program should begin to run: `python3 main.py`
